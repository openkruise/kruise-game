Kruise-Game utilizes the features of [Kruise](https://github.com/openkruise/kruise), including:
- In-Place Update
- Update sequence
- Ordinals reserve(skip)
- Pod probe marker
- …

## Why is Kruise-Game?
Game servers are stateful services, and there are differences in the operation and maintenance of each game server, which also increase with time. In Kubernetes, general workloads manage a batch of game servers according to pod templates, which cannot take into account the differences in game server status. Batch management and directional management conflict in K8s. **Kruise-Game** was born to resolve that. Kruise-Game contains two CRDs, GameServer and GameServerSet:

- `GameServer` is responsible for the management of the game server status. Users can customize the game server status to reflect the differences between game servers;
- `GameServerSet` is responsible for batch management of game servers. Users can customize update/reduction strategies according to the status of game servers.

Features:
- Game server status management
    - Mark the game servers status without affecting its lifecycle
- Flexible scaling/deletion mechanism
    - Support scaling down by user-defined status & priority
    - Support specifying the game server to delete directly
- Flexible update mechanism
    - Support hot update (in-place update)
    - Support updating game server by user-defined priority
    - Can control the range of the game servers to be updated
    - Can control the pace of the entire update process
- Custom service quality
    - Support probing game servers‘ containers and marking game server status automatically
