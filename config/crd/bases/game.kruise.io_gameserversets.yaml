                                object. When this field is specified, volume binding

                                of the DataSource field and as such if both fields
                                are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and

                                There are two important differences between DataSource
                                and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                feature gate to be enabled.'
